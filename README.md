# Smart Environmental Monitoring — Pilot: Effects on Student Productivity via Surveys & Sensors

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project builds a proof‑of‑concept system to monitor indoor environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity) using a microcontroller / Raspberry Pi + sensor + display, and correlate environment data with student productivity via surveys. The goal is to understand how factors like room climate affect comfort and performance in an academic / learning space. 

## 🎯 Motivation  
- Indoor environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.) play a significant role in comfort, concentration, and productivity — especially for students studying or working indoors.  
- By capturing real data rather than relying solely on subjective reports, this project aims to provide objective insights into how environment affects productivity.  
- This project demonstrates hands‑on skills in hardware interfacing, data capture, and data‑driven research — combining IoT, software development, and empirical evaluation.

## 🧰 Built With / Technologies  
- **Raspberry Pi** (or similar microcontroller / SBC) — for sensor interfacing and data logging.  
- **DHT11** (or DHT22) sensor — for measuring temperature and humidity.  
- **LCD / 16×2 (or suitable display)** — optional, to show real‑time readings.  
- **Python** (or language of your choice) — for sensor reading, data logging, and data output.  
- **CSV / JSON / SQLite / file-based storage** — to persist environment data over time.  
- **Survey + Analysis (via spreadsheet / script / statistical tool)** — to correlate environmental data with survey responses (student productivity, comfort, focus, etc.).  
- **Documentation / Paper** — includes research paper PDF summarizing methodology, data collection, analysis, and findings.
